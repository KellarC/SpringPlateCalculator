# SpringPlateCalculator

A simple weightlifting calculator web program using Spring that presents the number of weight plates needed on each side of an Olympic barbell (45 lbs) for a given weight. It was designed for use with the imperial pound (lb), rather than the metric kilogram (kg).

## Description

This is a Spring extension of the same algorithm also on my GitHub. It allows users to input their desired weight and calculates, for each side of the bar, the number of weight plates needed for each plate size commonly used in weightlifting.

## Features

- Input a desired weight in pounds (lbs).
- Exception handling for input less than 45 lbs or not divisible by 5.
- Calculates the number of weight plates required for each plate size:
  - 45 lbs
  - 25 lbs
  - 10 lbs
  - 5 lbs
  - 2.5 lbs
- Displays the quantity of each plate size needed per side in a text response.

## Usage

1. After running the application, type into your searchbar "localhost:8080" to reach the root page.
2. Enter your desired weight into the field and press the submit button.
